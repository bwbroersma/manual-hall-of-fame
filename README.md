# Hall of Fame for Hosters
This repository contains a manually maintained Hall of Fame for hosters which is published on Internet.nl.
New entries appear online by adding them to the "hosters.yaml" file, as this file is automatically parsed every 10 minutes. Just make sure this repository remains public. 

## Listing criteria
For hosters to be listed in our **Hall of Fame for Hosters** the following criteria must be met:
* Own domain 2x 100%: The hoster's own domain name, on which the company website is active, scores 100% in both the website test and the email test on Internet.nl;
* Offering of hosting services: The hoster explicitly offers hosting services for websites and e-mail on it's company website without limitations in the customer audience (like societies and clubs);
* Customer domains 2x 100%: The hoster  offers its customers the possibility to score 100% in both the website test and email test on Internet.nl;
* Trade register: The hoster's company name is mentioned as a trade name in the Trade Register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce or in a similar foreign trade register;
* Only per request: Inclusion in this Hall of Fame is voluntary and can be requested by the hoster by sending an e-mail to question@internet.nl.

## Automated compliance checks
The Internet.nl Dashboard is used to regularly check if the hosters listed in the **Hall of Fame for Hosters** are still on a double 100% score (mail and web) for the own domain. This is an automated check and will be performed twice per month. The result reports are publicly available:  
Shared report mail: https://dashboard.internet.nl/#/shared/report/76316334-3b12-404b-9bea-93307c107047  
Shared report web: https://dashboard.internet.nl/#/shared/report/46793684-324e-49d3-92c0-0c09f7981dc7  

## Delisting 
Non-compliant hosters will be manually delisted based on the following criteria and rules:
* If the test results are below 100% for 3 consecutive scans (approximately 6 weeks) regardless of the subtests that are failing.
* When we include new (sub)tests into our overall test score (the percentage), we will provide a grace period of 2 months (from the date of inclusion) for hosters in our Hall of Fame to become fully compliant (double 100% score).
* Delisting occurs for a period of at least 3 months, after which the hosters needs to manually reapply to be listed again.
* The hosters contact person will receive a notification of the delisting.
* There will be no communication prior to the delisting; it is the hosters responsibility to make sure (and check) whether the own domain is still on a double 100% score (for mail and web).

If there is another reason why a hoster should not be listed in our Hall of Fame for Hosters, please send an email to question@internet.nl using proper argumentation.

## Other rules
